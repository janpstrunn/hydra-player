# Hydra Audio Player

## What is it?

A beautiful audio player, yet **simple**!

It's supposed to be used in the Browser, and allows to easily change tracks from the provided local audio files.

It also display the currently played music, even in the tab!

Some other features like looping and speed can be tweaked by right-clicking the audio player.

It uses **Html**, **JavaScript** and the **Zepto.js**.

## Why?

Because the default method to run audio in the browser is extremely powerful, but doesn't allow to easily play a playlist and change it's tracks with a click. Also, I couldn't find anything simple and functional enough that does it by this way.

## How to use it

Just open the `hydra-player.html` file using the browser, choose your files and enjoy.
